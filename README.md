## ... may the truth lie beneath your confession.

## Inspiration
Was learning flask's NN so thought what if there is a database involving universal truths and lies... Then went in to make an extremely simple NN model consisting of about 36 data points. Only wanted to work on how powerful Neural Nets can be with less data too.

## What it does
Inputs a statement and gives a boolean output - True/False.
It's more of a fun game.

## How we built it
Simple HTML5 and complicated CSS3 for frontend. The backend was built on Flask in order to compensate for speed issues.

## Challenges we ran into
Initially, I started with Brain.js but unfortunately, it didn't go well. I am assuming because it's more into the client-side. Most of my time was spent in CSS because I have never been good at designing a web-page. I have never done it before, professionally. The transition from Brain.js to Flask consumed a lot of time and efforts. I don't know how to deploy a Flask app.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I build a project on what I have not even completely learnt, I am proud of that.

## What we learned
Brain.js basics. Flask as HTML backend, I learnt it in the past week. It was a good experience.

## What's next for Toogle Foogle
Expand data and improve the algorithm to precisely predict the true percentage of the depiction of the result (right now, there are only dummy values 75 and 90). I'll need to focus more on the design aspects of my web-app.
